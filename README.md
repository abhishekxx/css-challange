<!..............SEO Challenge Solution......................!>

How would you propose an SEO strategy to maximize its visibility, attract a larger audience, and improve its ranking on search engines like Google?
-> There are various ways to maximise seo strategy in nextjs:

#Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG):Websites often rely heavily on JavaScript, which can affect search engine bots from indexing content. Using SSR with Next.js or SSG ensures search engines can index all content effectively.

#Meta Tags: Giving every page their unique meta tags for title, description, and keywords, which allows improving a page’s visibility on search engines e.g., Google, Bing

#Lazy Loading for Images: lazy loading which allows you to load images only when they are about to come into the viewport, improving page load time.
For eg:The <Image /> component from next/image automatically adds the
loading = “lazy ” attribute to the images for lazy loading, which allows you to load images only when needed

how would you measure the success of this SEO strategy? What metrics or KPIs would you track to demonstrate that the strategy is achieving the desired results? You can also discuss the tools you would use to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of your SEO efforts.
->

1. Tracking Traffic using Google Analytics
   The first and most obvious metric is the amount of traffic our site gets from search engines like Google. Monitoring the growth of our traffic over time shows whether an SEO strategy is successful or not.
2. Search Engine Rankings
   Search engine rankings for relevant keywords shows how well the SEO strategy is performing. Tools like Google Search Console and third-party tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz can help you track the rankings of targeted keywords over time.
